        <h1>Welcome to the Internet</h1>
        <p> The Internet is known as a revolutionary phenomenon of interconnected computers, which has fundamentally transformed society (Britannica). The origins of the internet can be traced back to ARPANET, which was a project commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1960s (Britannica). Originally, ARPANET was designed to make a decentralized communication network that would be capable of withstanding nuclear attacks. (Internet Society). Over many decades to come, the Internet experienced significant growth and evolution, going through advancements such as the development of TCP/IP protocols in the 1970s (Internet Society). The protocols that took place included standardized data transmission, global connectivity facilitation, and making the internet accessable in daily life (Internet Society). Moreover, in the 1980s, the establishment of NSFNET had an important role in expanding Internet access beyond academic and research inquiries, which lead to its commercialization and adoption to many households (History.com). At this point, this significant evolution recollects the Internet's transformation from a small, (unheard of by many) research tool, to a global network that's involved in nearly every aspect of modern society. The impact of the internet extends beyond communication and information exchange. It can now influence many fields such as education, entertainment, commerce, social work, and governance. The internet has a strong ability to connect people and resources across large distances around the world, providing access to knowledge, empowering communities, and fosterering global innovation. The internet has become a major part of everyday life. As technology continues to advance, the Internet's role in the future of society will only grow larger. </p>
        <p> The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This invention revolutionized how information can be accessed and shared throughout many standpoints (History.com). Berners-Lee was a computer scientist who came up with a system of "hypertext", allowing users to easily navigate interconnected documents using hyperlinks (History.com). His concept created a baseline for the World Wide Web, which provided access to numerous amounts of information and created platforms for communication across the globe (History.com). The beginning of the World Wide Web era was a milestone in Internet history, creating connectivity and collaboration (History.com). As the Web grew in advancement it became a platform for both creativity and innovation. This era enabled individuals and businesses to share ideas, commerce, and build communities globally (History.com). At this point in time, the World Wide Web is synonymous with the Internet itself, this serves as a gateway to information platforms, as well as a catalyst for economic and social progresses (History.com). The influence of the internet shapes how we learn, work, and interact in the digital era since the World Wide Web has transformed society. As its evolution continues, there will be greater possibilities for global collaboration, creativity, and communication.  </p>
        <p> The Internet has impacted the world socially, economically, and culturally, beyond its infastructure (Britannica). This era of the internet has strongly impactede communication, people are able to connect instantly, as well as share information across major distances (Britannica). In addition to this, the Internet also democratized access to knowledge. It has provided individuals with countless opportunities to gain knowledge and learn more. (Britannica). The Internet also has a strong contribution to the rise of e-commerce and online marketplace. This has transformed the way goods and services are sold and bought, with brands, industries, and economies becoming revolutionalized. (Britannica). In addition, the Internet has grown online communities and social networks, creating important connections between individuals with shared interests and similarities within one another (Britannica). As it continues to grow and evolve, the internet's influence will continue to change the future of work, education, and human interaction- for better, or for worse (Britannica). The Internet has become essential for the navigation of the modern world. The Internet has a strong ability to bridge barriers concerning global collaboration and cooperation. However, the Internet can also present challenges regarding security, privacy, and digital inequality throughout the world. </p>
